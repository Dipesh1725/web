After that we learned HTML and CSS. At first time I become nervous of seeing much more HTML and CSS tags because since I never known with much code. I was taken much more time for learning this tag then to my friends. I used to read many books and online web site. After my best effort HTML tag become easy and easily I code for the programming. Also problem in CSS then I used to discuss with my friends and subjects teacher for solving this problem.  After that I learned it effectively a CSS tags. Since many attempts I learned the tags according to first brief. In tutorial I also used to design a multiple web site and web page. I used to learn in various style. Thinking about learning programming over last few months Iâ€™m hardworking student. So, I work hard to get it. Now I design web site according to client wish. I spent much more time to develop these skills with different source. In this term we learned to make website and designed with CSS. Subline text was used for making web page. In this term we have learned primary design of web designing
